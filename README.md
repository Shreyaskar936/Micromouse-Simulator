🐭 Micromouse Maze Simulator
An interactive desktop application that simulates maze-solving using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. 
Designed with a Tkinter-based GUI, this tool allows users to create custom mazes, set start/end points, and visualize the pathfinding process in real time.

✨ Features
1. Interactive grid with customizable size
2. Click-based obstacle placement
3. Start and end point selection
4.Random maze generation with adjustable obstacle density
5. Animated BFS pathfinding with step-by-step traversal
6. Distance visualization for each cell
7. Reset and simulation controls

🛠️ Technologies Used
1. Language: Python
2. GUI Library: Tkinter
3. Algorithm: Breadth-First Search (BFS)
